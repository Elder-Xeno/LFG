## Getting Started: 
With a very simple sign up system, a user can create a profile with the option to upload a profile picture, then add muiltple platforms from a list of next gen gaming platforms to their collection.
The user can then add games using information gathered from the IGDB API.
The user can filter through their gaming collection via what platforms they have in their collection and by what genre/s the games are.
A user can also search the username of other users and browse thier collections.


## Planned Future Enhancements.
For future versions of the app, we have planned a chat function for users to live chat with one another, with plans to make a direct messaging service available also.
